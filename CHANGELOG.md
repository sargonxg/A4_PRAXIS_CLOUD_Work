## [3.6.0] — 2026-03-28

### Security

- **Wrapped 6 unprotected AI routes with `withAuth()`** — `claude-analyze`, `deep-research`, `grounded-search`, `media-analyze`, `research`, `terminology` were previously exposed without authentication verification or rate limiting. All now require valid Firebase session + enforce 100 req/min rate limit.
- **Added credit deduction to `auto-structure`** — This resource-intensive pipeline (web scraping, feed polling, multi-tool initialization) was missing `checkAndDeductCredits()`. Now deducts 5 credits (ai_research tier).

### Audited

- Full API route audit: all 59 routes verified for auth, credits, situation context, error handling
- All 35+ app pages verified for `useSituationGuard()` — 3 intentional exceptions (settings, situations list, new situation)
- All 21 chat tools verified as wired to assistant via `tacitusTools` in chat route
- Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments found in API layer
- Zero demo data leaks into production paths confirmed
- All environment variable usage verified — no hardcoded secrets

### Documentation

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
- Added `TOOL_AUDIT.md` — complete tool-by-tool wiring status with API routes, pages, and recommendations
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` — reflects v3.6 state, corrected tool count, added audit findings
- Updated `README.md` — professional format with full architecture, all 59 API routes, improvement roadmap
