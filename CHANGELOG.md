## [3.7.1] — 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Intelligence Readiness dashboard** — Renamed "Situation Health" to "Intelligence Readiness" with overall status counter ("3/5 core tools ready"), color-coded semaphore dot (green/amber/grey), and spinning indicator while tools are still seeding.
- **Auto-polling for tool seeding** — Dashboard polls every 8 seconds for up to 3 minutes after situation creation. As each tool finishes seeding (actor-profiles, risk-monitor, early-warning, conflict-graph, stakeholder-map), its semaphore flips from "Generate" to green checkmark in real-time.
- **Building state with progress skeleton** — When auto-structure is running, shows animated skeleton for each core tool with spinning indicators. User sees tools "light up" progressively.
- **Extended tools section** — Added 5 more tools to the readiness grid: Dossier, Negotiation Prep, Media Roundup, Sanctions Tracker, Briefing Room. Separated into "Core" (auto-seeded) and "Analysis & Intelligence" (user-triggered) sections.
- **Tool semaphore component** — Reusable `ToolSemaphore` with click-to-navigate, hover states, and visual status indicators.

### Audited

- Full tool page data flow audit: all 42 pages verified for AiPopulate/usePersistedToolData pattern, API route wiring, buildToolContext usage, first-visit behavior.
- Complete page → toolId → API route → data source → storage map created.
- All 34 AI routes confirmed using withAuth + checkAndDeductCredits + buildToolContext.
- Situation creation → auto-structure → tool seeding → dashboard display pipeline verified end-to-end.

## [3.7.0] — 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Real-time credit sync** — Firestore `onSnapshot` listener on user profile. Credits update instantly in the UI after Stripe payments, AI tool usage, or admin adjustments. No page refresh needed.
- **Pricing → checkout flow** — Clicking "Start Analyst Plan" on pricing page passes `?plan=analyst` through login, which redirects to `/app/settings?upgrade=analyst`, auto-triggering Stripe checkout. Full end-to-end payment flow now works.
- **Payment success/cancelled banners** — Settings page shows styled banners when arriving from Stripe (`?payment=success` or `?payment=cancelled`). Includes dismiss buttons.
- **CSP hardened** — Removed `unsafe-eval` from Content-Security-Policy (XSS protection). Added Stripe, HDX HAPI, World Bank API to `connect-src` and `frame-src` allowlists.

### Fixed

- **Unified subscription tiers** — `SubscriptionTier` type aligned to `free|analyst|team|enterprise` matching pricing page and Stripe metadata.
- **Stripe webhook hardened** — Added idempotency, audit trail logging, proper error responses for Stripe retries.
- **Stripe env var documentation** — Added all `STRIPE_PRICE_*` vars to `.env.local.example`.

### Removed

- **Dead code: `src/lib/subscription/tiers.ts`** — Conflicting pricing definitions with zero imports. Deleted.

---

## [3.6.2] — 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Token refresh loop** — Firebase ID tokens expire after 1 hour. Added `onIdTokenChanged()` listener in `auth-context.tsx` that detects token changes and proactively refreshes 5 minutes before expiry. Session cookie is automatically updated with fresh tokens. Users no longer hit 401s on long sessions.
- **Error boundaries** — Added Next.js `error.tsx` at root, `/app`, and `/demo` levels. Wired existing `ErrorBoundary` component into `AppShell` main content area. Any tool page crash now shows a styled fallback with "Try Again" and "Report Issue" buttons instead of a white screen.

## [3.6.1] — 2026-03-28

### Security — Auth Hardening

- **CRITICAL: Removed unsafe JWT fallback in `admin.ts`** — Previously decoded JWT payloads without cryptographic verification when Admin SDK verification failed. Attacker could craft fake JWTs to impersonate any user. Now strictly requires verified tokens via Firebase Admin SDK.
- **CRITICAL: Removed silent credit bypass on Firestore failure** — `with-credits.ts` returned `allowed: true` when Firestore was unavailable, allowing unlimited AI usage. Now returns 503 and blocks the request.
- **CRITICAL: Fixed credit deduction race condition** — `firestore.ts` used check-then-deduct pattern vulnerable to concurrent requests double-spending credits. Now uses `runTransaction()` for atomic check + deduct.
- **HIGH: Removed unsafe JWT decode in `with-credits.ts`** — `getSessionUid()` decoded JWT without verification to extract UID. Now uses `verifyIdToken()` from Admin SDK.
- **HIGH: Added server-side token validation to session route** — `POST /api/auth/session` stored tokens without verification. Now verifies token via Firebase Admin SDK before setting cookie.
- **HIGH: Added CSRF/origin validation to session route** — Validates `origin` header matches `host` to prevent cross-site session manipulation.
- **HIGH: Fixed rate limiter memory leak** — `rateLimitMap` in `with-auth.ts` grew unbounded. Added periodic garbage collection (every 5 minutes) to remove expired entries.
- **HIGH: Hardened Firestore security rules** — Users could previously modify `credits`, `totalCreditsUsed`, `subscription` fields directly via client SDK. Rules now block writes to protected fields; only Admin SDK (server-side) can modify credits.
- **MEDIUM: Moved Firebase client config to environment variables** — API key, project ID, and other client config moved from hardcoded values to `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` env vars with backwards-compatible defaults.

### Changed

- Updated `.env.local.example` with Firebase client SDK env var documentation

## [3.6.0] — 2026-03-28

### Security

- **Wrapped 6 unprotected AI routes with `withAuth()`** — `claude-analyze`, `deep-research`, `grounded-search`, `media-analyze`, `research`, `terminology` were previously exposed without authentication verification or rate limiting. All now require valid Firebase session + enforce 100 req/min rate limit.
- **Added credit deduction to `auto-structure`** — This resource-intensive pipeline (web scraping, feed polling, multi-tool initialization) was missing `checkAndDeductCredits()`. Now deducts 5 credits (ai_research tier).

### Audited

- Full API route audit: all 59 routes verified for auth, credits, situation context, error handling
- All 35+ app pages verified for `useSituationGuard()` — 3 intentional exceptions (settings, situations list, new situation)
- All 21 chat tools verified as wired to assistant via `tacitusTools` in chat route
- Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments found in API layer
- Zero demo data leaks into production paths confirmed
- All environment variable usage verified — no hardcoded secrets

### Documentation

- Added `TOOL_AUDIT.md` — complete tool-by-tool wiring status with API routes, pages, and recommendations
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` — reflects v3.6 state, corrected tool count, added audit findings
- Updated `README.md` — professional format with full architecture, all 59 API routes, improvement roadmap
